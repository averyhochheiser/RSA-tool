# RSA-tool
Learning project: RSA from scratch in Python

Includes key generation, encryption/decryption for numbers and text, and utility functions such as the extended Euclidean algorithm, modular arithmetic, and convering text to ints.

Obviously not for anything in need of serious or real world use :)

Includes simple CLI for encryption only (as of now)

```python .\rsa_tool.py [message to encrypt] ``` 

This will show you how it encrypts, and to decrypt there is code in rsa_tool to uncomment
